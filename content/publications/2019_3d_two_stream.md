In order to obtain global contextual information precisely from videos with heavy camera motions and scene changes, this study proposes an improved spatiotemporal two-stream neural network architecture with a novel convolutional fusion layer. The three main improvements of this study are: 1) the Resnet-101 network has been integrated into the two streams of the target network independently; 2) two kinds of feature maps (i.e., the optical flow motion and RGB-channel information) obtained by the corresponding convolution layer of two streams respectively are superimposed on each other; 3) the temporal information is combined with the spatial information by the integrated three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract more latent information from the videos. The proposed approach was tested by using UCF-101 and HMDB51 benchmarking datasets and the experimental results show that the proposed two-stream 3D CNN model can gain substantial improvement on the recognition rate in video-based analysis.
